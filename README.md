* [QT5](https://www.qt.io/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Simply download to use the application.

Now, install the dependencies mentioned in prerequisites section.

Now, simply run the main.py file with the command `python main.py`

### Prerequisites

* Python3
* PyQT5
* SQLite

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The application is divided into 8 different interfaces.
* Login Page
Appropiate user enters correct Login ID and Password and proceeds into his/her interface..

* Infomation about Database
Basic data, i.e courses offered by Department and Faculty which are associated with the courses are shown here.

* Department's Head Interface
Head of the Department can assign new faculties to appropiate courses, delete faculties, enroll new students and assign them courses and faculties of their choice  and delete students. All these have their own interfaces.
If any faculty who is assigned with students is deleted, then all students under that faculty is shifted to other faculty who is associated with same course automatically.
This user has to assign IDs and Passwords to the other users too.
To keep it simple, the default ID and password of Head is set to "admin", which can be changed from "main.py" file.
By default there are 4 subjects and 4 faculties, one assiociated with each subject, which can be changed from "database.py" file.

* Faculty's Interface
Faculties can login into their portals and take attendance of all students assigned to their class.

* Student's Interface
Students can login into their portals and see their overall attendance in the Subjects they have opted for. They can also see attendance date-wise status.

All these data is stored into database.db file which is created by SQLite in the folder where program is stored.
